          <li><strong>Sep 2025–Present —</strong>
            Undergraduate Research Assistant, Acquisition Lab, UMD
            <p class="archive-info">Acq Lab (PI: Jeff Lidz) designs and runs experiments on child language acquisition.
              Lab is staffed by graduate and undergraduate students. As an undergrad, my responsibilities have been
              predominately logistics/data organization related. During weekly lab meetings, I offer feedback on
              experimental design and research presentations for conferences. </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Aug 2024–Sep 2025 —</strong>
            Critical Technology Protection Decision Framework (CPT-DF) Intern, ARLIS
            <p class="archive-info">Developed a Julia-based simulation of the innovation and startup ecosystem to inform
              government policy to protect critical technology. Model was originally in Python, took on the job of
              porting to Julia, leading to over 250% performance improvements. Design emphasized modularity,
              customizability, and reproducibility. Towards the end, I designed and implemented a customizable
              visualization interface for innovation metrics and network statistics. Role was offered following RISC
              internship from Summer '24, and I was repeatedly retained beyond my original contract.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Jun 2025–Aug 2025 —</strong>
            NSF/NIST Research Fellow, TRAILS Lab, UMD
            <p class="archive-info">Led project direction and design decisions for a team of five undergraduate/graduate
              students to develop a verification system for AI visual-question-answering (VQA) systems for blind &
              low-vision users. Conducted an extensive literature review on model verification, and decided to use
              sentence embeddings to measure output consistency, thus validity. Presented findings to other researchers
              at TRAILS at the end of the work period.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Jan 2025–May 2025 —</strong>
            Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, LING311: Phonology I, UMD
            <p class="archive-info">Prepared and administered in-class exercises on phonological topics like: rule
              ordering, distinctive features. Tracked learning and provided feedback for 15 of 30 students in the class.
              Gave input on test and assignment design, as well as technical support to the instructor.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Sep 2024–Dec 2024 —</strong>
            Undergraduate Research Assistant, Department of Linguistics, UMD
            <p class="archive-info">Ran experiments with PhD student Malhaar Shah to investigate the interpretation of
              quantifiers 'more' and 'most,' to understand the "algorithm" or truth conditional formula humans use to
              evaluate propositions. Following this research, continued to meet to discuss topics in semantics
              including: logical form, quantifiers & conservativity, comparitives, and type shifting.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Sep 2022–Dec 2024 —</strong>
            Honors College Citation, University of Maryland Honors College
            <p class="archive-info">Completed a sequence of interdisciplinary seminars: <i>Collective Behavior,
                Arbitrating Body Rights, Politics of Laziness, and Ecology of Poverty.</i>, designed to provide breadth
              across social and natural sciences and critical engagement with current issues.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Jun 2024–Aug 2024 —</strong>
            RISC Intern, ARLIS
            <p class="archive-info">Conducted research with a interdisciplinary team to synthesize recommendations on
              U.S. innovation policy to protect IP while fostering economic growth. Presented findings to ARLIS,
              government stakeholders, and intelligence community professionals. Policy analysts gave positive feedback
              on our actionable recommendations, and agreed with our assessment of current U.S. innovation policy gaps.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Oct 2023–Jun 2024 —</strong>
            Undergraduate Researcher, Language Science Center, UMD
            <p class="archive-info">Led programming efforts on research investigating how language models learn
              syntactic constraints. Humans learn language by generalizing, which helps us learn with such limited
              input. Our investigation was into whether LMs did the same. Used filler-gap dependencies, which linguists
              hypothesize share an underlying representation, to probe model learning. Actively participated in writing
              and editing process. Paper was selected for a talk at 49th BU Conference on Language Development in
              November.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Sep 2023–Dec 2023 —</strong>
            Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, CMSC132: Object Oriented Programming II, UMD
            <p class="archive-info">Provided personalized support to CS students during office hours and review
              sessions. Answered general programming questions, guided students to solve projects on their own, and
              helped prepare students for exams. Provided personalized feedback for exams and projects.</p>
