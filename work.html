            Undergraduate Research Assistant, Acquisition Lab, UMD
            <p class="archive-info">Acq Lab (PI: Jeff Lidz) designs and runs experiments on child language acquisition.
              Lab is staffed by graduate and undergraduate students. As an undergrad, my responsibilities have been
              predominately logistics/data organization related. During weekly lab meetings, I offer feedback on
              experimental design and research presentations for conferences. </p>

          <li><strong>Aug 2024–Sep 2025 —</strong>
            Critical Technology Protection Decision Framework (CPT-DF) Intern, ARLIS
            <p class="archive-info">Developed a Julia-based simulation of the innovation and startup ecosystem to inform
              government policy to protect critical technology. Model was originally in Python, took on the job of
              porting to Julia, leading to over 250% performance improvements. Design emphasized modularity,
              customizability, and reproducibility. Towards the end, I designed and implemented a customizable
              visualization interface for innovation metrics and network statistics. Role was offered following RISC
              internship from Summer '24, and I was repeatedly retained beyond my original contract.</p>

          <li><strong>Jun 2025–Aug 2025 —</strong>
            NSF/NIST Research Fellow, TRAILS Lab, UMD
            <p class="archive-info">Led project direction and design decisions for a team of five undergraduate/graduate
              students to develop a verification system for AI visual-question-answering (VQA) systems for blind &
              low-vision users. Conducted an extensive literature review on model verification, and decided to use
              sentence embeddings to measure output consistency, thus validity. Presented findings to other researchers
              at TRAILS at the end of the work period.</p>
