    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>
      I am an undergraduate at the University of Maryland studying computer science and linguistics. My passions are in
      computational linguistics, using computational methods to better understand human language, and vice versa. I've
      contributed to research through ARLIS and TRAILS, and UMD involving AI trustworthiness, language model
      generalization, and agent-based economic simulations.
