    <h3>Hey!</h3>
    <p>
        My great-great-grandfather given name is Robert Melvin Hopkins IV (hence the great-great-grandfather), but that's a little long so I just go by Rob or Melv(in).\n
        I'm studying computer science (major) and linguistics (major) at THE University of Maryland. As of writing this, I'm a sophomore.\n
        For the linguists among us, I consider myself an "s-side" linguist. I usually dive into syntax, but you can't ignore the sound side of things. 
        It's like trying to appreciate the delicious meal that is human language without savoring the flavorsâ€”you just can't skip the phonetic seasoning.
        I also love historical linguistics! Nothing is quite as fascinating as studying how languages change and grow over time!
    </p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        Outside of computer science and linguistic study, I'm drawn to music, American football (go Ravens!), constructed languages (conlangs), urbanism, and cooking. 

        I am a proud Marylander, born & raised.

    <h3>School</h3>
    <p>
        As mentioned earlier, I'm a double major in computer science and linguistics. I'm lucky enough to attend Maryland where both programs are outstanding!\n
        In computer science, my classes involve computer systems, programming languages, and algorithms. 
        In linguistics, I focus on syntax, the structure of language. I <i>desperately wish</i> UMD offered a class in making conlangs, they're tons of fun and they
        really help practice lingustic concepts. To make a language from scratch, you <i>really</i> have to understand what goes into it!\n

        My conlangs: (all continuously under construction):
        <table class="conlang-table", width="100%", border-collapse="collapse">
            <tr>
              <td width="25%">Name</td>
              <td width="75%">Info</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
