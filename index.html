    <h4>(many call me Melvin)</h4>

    <h3>Hey!</h3>
    <p>
        My great-great-grandfather given name is Robert Melvin Hopkins IV (hence the great-great-grandfather), but that's a little long so I just go by Rob or Melv(in).
        I'm studying computer science (major) and linguistics (major) at THE University of Maryland. As of writing this, I'm a sophomore.
        For the linguists among us, I consider myself an "s-side" linguist. I usually dive into syntax, but you can't ignore the sound side of things. 
        It's like trying to appreciate the delicious meal that is human language without savoring the flavorsâ€”you just can't skip the phonetic seasoning.
        I also love historical linguistics! Nothing is quite as fascinating as studying how languages change and grow over time!
    </p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        Outside of computer science and linguistic study, I'm drawn to music, American football (go Ravens!), constructed languages (conlangs), 
        public transportation, cooking, skiing/snowboarding, and Super Smash Bros. Melee.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a proud Marylander, born & raised. This does mean that I'm a psycho for our flag, it's gorgeous.

    <h3>School</h3>
    <p>
        As mentioned earlier, I'm a double major in computer science and linguistics. I'm lucky enough to attend Maryland where both programs are outstanding!
        In computer science, my classes involve computer systems, programming languages, and algorithms. 
        In linguistics, I focus on syntax, the structure of language. 
        I <i>desperately wish</i> UMD offered a class in making conlangs. To make a language from scratch, you <i>really</i> have to understand what goes into it!

        I TA for computer science classes, and I'm involved in both the Linguistics Club and the Smash Club. 
        I am also currently a research assistant and co-author on a paper on how language models learn syntax!

    <h3>Work</h3>
    <p>
        Under construction!

    <h3>Other projects</h3>
    <p>
        Here are some favorite other projects of mine, outside of school or work:
        <ul id="project-table">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <b>My conlangs (all continuously under construction):</b>
                <table class="conlang-table", style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid black;">
                    <tr>
                        <th style="border-bottom: 1px solid black; width: 25%; text-align: center;">Title</th>
                        <th style="border-bottom: 1px solid black; width: 75%; text-align: center;">Info</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td style="border-bottom: 1px solid black; width: 25%;">TBD</td>
                        <td style="border-bottom: 1px solid black; width: 75%;">
                            Imagine if you had a functionally infinite number of mouths and experienced time compltetely differently.
                            That's the idea behind this language! Each lexeme corresponds to what we think of as an adjective, and every part of 
                            speech is built by saying those "ad-morphs" simultaneously! It's got a very steep learning curve for humans 
                            (you need the afformentioned infinite mouths and the ability to dissect "words" into their underlying ad-morphs instantaneously) 
                            so I don't recommend endeavoring to learn this one... 
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>

                    </tr>
                </table>
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <b>Melv's Conlang Tools:</b>
                When I'm making my constructed languages, there are some processes involved in generating a lexicon, simulating organic sound change, etc. which are 
                done often enough that I made a few tools to help automate the process! 
                The code for these tools is located <a href="https://github.com/rmhopkins4/Conlang-Tools", target="_blank">here!</a>
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <b>This very website:</b>
                I will try to keep this place updated with my personal goings-on, and I often make changes to the design or content here!
                Source code is also available on my Github <a href="https://github.com/rmhopkins4/rmhopkins4.github.io", target="_blank">here.</a>
