  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I love learning about the mental computation behind deriving meaning from language. 
    For example, how do we compute quantifiers like <i>most</i>, when there are theoretically infinite ways to reach the same truth conditions? 
    If we do it consistently one way, how do children learn that without data to distinguish between hypotheses? 
    Do we use Bayesian-style reasoning to compute implicatures in sentences? 
    What kinds of constraints exist on what's possible in human language, and how can we explain that symbolically or computationally?
    When a linguistics class involves sets, functions, and formal logic, I feel right at home.

    Outside of coursework and research, I enjoy biking, and running to stay active. 
    When I'm indoors, I like playing challenging video games, often made harder by self-imposed challenges, like using only base-level weapons. 
    I love to cook, but hate baking. 
    I follow politics closely, and like arguing about the best way to spend transit funding. 
    I love the Baltimore Ravens and Orioles, and of course the Terps.
